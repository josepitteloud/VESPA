/******************************************************************************
**
** Project Vespa: Data Quality BI Checks Reporting
**
** This is the procedure to collect the basic Adsmart metrics which are reported against...
**
**  
** Refer also to:
**
**
** Code sections:
**
**
**1)	Gather Metrics (except Household Metric See 5) below) by two different dates 
**	a.	Local Date – defined as midnight to 23.59.59 on any given date.
**	b.	Broadcast Date – defined as 06.00 on date 1 to 5.59.59 on date 2 so a 
**	broadcast date of 6th May 2014 starts at 6.00am on 06/05/2014 and ends at 05.59.59 on 07/05/2014.
**2)	Collect the total number of Adsmart only slots and the sum of Impressions against the Volatile and Static Adsmart data 
**	only back to an agreed date.  
**	Adsmart only defined as where an Adsmart Campaign Key > 0.  
**	There are some other calculations which are in this query but are not used as it was decided that they were not as crucial.
**3)	Collect the total number of Adsmart specific segments against the Volatile and Static Adsmart data only back to an agreed date.  
**	Adsmart only defined as where an Adsmart Campaign Key > 0.
**4)	Collect the total number of Adsmart specific campaigns against the Volatile and Static Adsmart data only back to an agreed date.  
**	Adsmart only defined as where an Adsmart Campaign Key > 0.
**5)	Collect the total number of Adsmart households against the fact_household_segment back to an agreed date.  
**	Only looks at those Household Segments which are matched to an 
**	Olive Household Key as the way these segments work there are a vast amount which do not get matched 
**	and the BI team are only interested in those that are matched (FACT_HOUSEHOLD_SEGMENT  where household_key > 0).
