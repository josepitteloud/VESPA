/******************************************************************************
**
** Project Vespa: Capping 2 - Core table creation
**
** This script initiates all the tables used in the Capping refresg build. They
** get built once in vespa_analysts, then we just refer to it later. Makes a
** lot of things a lot easier and faster, at the expense of a slightly more
** complicated preparation phase and increased overnight load, but hey, we have
** to do those things anyway at some point and this moves all the effort to a
* strictly less high stress part of the week.
**
** See also:
**
**  http://rtci/Vespa1/Capping.aspx
**
** Though, heh, currently that still refers to Capping 1, but that'll get an
** update soon, and will be much happier for it.
**
** Also: even though we are defining all these tables here, the tables that
** actually do the cache capping for us are dynamically built, one for each
** day, with the naming convention vespa_analysts.Vespa_daily_augs_YYYYMMDD
** where YYYYMMDD is the timestamp of the corresponding daily table.
**
** Code sections / Table categories:
**
**      Part A:       Processing tables: things that data goes through
**              A01 - The table of raw logs
**              A02 - The table of events and their start times
**              A03 - Table of first programme in each viewing event
**              A04 - A table of channel lookups
**              A05 - The box lookup for profiling
**
**      Part B:       Processing tables for BARB minute stuff
**              B01 - The fuill minutes spanned by viewing events
**              B02 - The bits overhanging minute boundires at the start and end of the events
**              B03 -
**              B04 -
**              B05 -
**
**
**      Part C:       Processing tables for calculation & storing caps
**              C01 - The table containing cap decisions
**              C02 - Bucket assignment lookup
**              C03 - Holding pen - last stop before dynamically named tables
**
**      Part D: D01 - Structural placeholder for daily tables
**
**      Part Q:       QA tables: things where we track suitability
**              Q01 - Ongoing QA totals of total viewing before / after caping
**              Q02 - Ongoing totals of BARB minute-by-minute consistency totals
**              Q03 - Historic tracking of total viewing per day
**              Q04 - ....
**
** Sybase 15 client note: Sybase has some annoying behavioural changes from the
** client for Sybase 12, and if you have the wrong client settings you might get
** syntax errors (really? WTF?). The setting you need are hidden under:
**  Tools->Options->SybaseIQ->Commands
** There are two check boxes, "Commit after every statement" and "Commit on exit
** or disconnect" and you want to make sure both are ticked.
**
** Also: there aren't many permissions here because all of the results tables
** are mostly dynamically generated in the weekly refresh script. There's kind
** of a placeholder here, so you can see what it should look like though.
