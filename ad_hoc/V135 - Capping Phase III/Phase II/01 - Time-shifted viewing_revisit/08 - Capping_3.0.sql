** Project Vespa: Capping 2 - Daily update process
**
** This script has the big procedure which calculates the caps for one day and
** puts the results in it's own dynamically named table, in kind of the same
** naming convention as the daily tables with all the data.
**
** One complication in this build is the treatment of events that span the BARB
** day, and really, we have to make sure that the capping record is in the same
** daily table as the viewing record to which it applies. That said, we can throw
** those checks in as a unit test thing.
**
** Refer also to:
**
**  http://rtci/Vespa1/Capping.aspx
**
** Though, heh, currently that still refers to Capping 1, but that'll get an
** update soon, and will be much happier for it.
**
** So we're building caps with viewing timeshifted by up to 28 days. That is,
** if anything is timeshifted by any more than 28 days, it'll cease to exist
** for the Vespa universe. We're also building these things one day at a time
** with no more than one day of viewing data in the processing loop at any one
** time. Still don't know exactly how we're treating the caps that spill over
** the daily viewing boundry... the maximum cap limit is four hours, yes, so
** that's as far as we'd have to go back? Well, there's also the updates to
** manage; I think for each loop we'll consider the juristiction of each loop
** to be all those records which are just on the daily table of question. We
** are going back however many days to cap the timeshifted stuff, so broadcasts
** around the boundaries are not so much of an issue at all. Means we have to
** get a chunk of viewing from the previous daily table, starting at whatever
** the absolute maximum of cap bound is (which is a shame because that will
** bleed into the previous day's peak...)
**
**
** Code sections:
**
**  A) SET UP   A01 - Initialising required variables, notifying the Logger
**
**  B) GET THE VIEWING DATA
**
**              B01 - Get the viewing data from VESPA
**
**  C) CREATE THE CAPS
**
**              C01* - Collect viewing data
**              C02 - Condense viewing data into event listing
**              C03 - Add the customer DB metadata (some non-cust DB sources too)
**              C04 - Make all the Ntiles
**              C05 - These are tables of ntiles?
**              C06 - All the different tables of caps
**              C07 - Moving caps back onto central tables
**              C08 - Global capping bounds
**              C09 - Distribution of capping bounds (just for QA)
**
**  D) APPLY CAPS TO VIEWING DATA
**
**              D01* - Adding customer metadata to viewing
**              D02 - Determine capping application
**              D03 - Get bounds on duration-replacement lookup
**              D04 - Randomly choose replacement duration for capped events
**              D05 - Assign new end time
**              D06* - Put capping on original main viewing table
**              D07 - Investigation of total viewing during process
**              D08 - Profiling durations before and after capping
**
**  E) ADD ADDITIONAL FIELDS TO THE VIEWING DATA
**
**              E01 - Add Playback and Vosdal flags
**
**  G) TRANSFER CAPPED DATA TO DYNAMIC TABLE
**
**              G01 - Table creation - using same YYYYMMDD datestamp format
**              G02 - Dynamic table population
**
**  J) WEEKLY PROFILING BUILD (DIFFERENT PROC TO THE DAILY CAP BUILD)
**
**              J01 - Table cleansing
**              J02 - Primary / Secondary box flags
**              J03 - ...
**
**  R) RESET PROCEDURE - FOR ALL THE TEMPORARY / TRASNIENT THINGS, NOT THE HISTORIC DAILY AUGMENT DATA
**
** *: control totals on viewing data total duration taken after these sections
**
** Also: QA Extraction are marked by "##QA##EQ##" so do a search for that string to find the
** queries to run for control totals, etc. They'll be commented out as they're not part of
** the main build, but everything they need should be constructed.
**
** So: We've also got BARB minutes at the end of this script. Think we might build
** those into the Capping Cache as well, because it's useful. Let us do minute by
** minute really *really* easily.
**
** That said, this guy is still going to receieve massive rebuilding to process only
** a day at a time, actually cache things historically, log control totals, even get
** out some controlled builds for QA, generally all that good stuff.
**
** Things to do:
** 7/ Automated QA, including... total hours watched? split by what?
** 12/ Then we need to rebuild the thing again for the Phase 2 viewing data structure
** 17/ There's no use of "recorded_time_utc" in here at all? How are we managing the
**      timeshifting of stuff, by broadcast date or by consumption date? BARB minute
**      etc really wants to be done by consumption date. From memory "x_viewing_start_time"
**      isn't properly set for all records and you have to juggle "recorded_time_utc"
**      yourself, so, yeah, we may have to poke around with that. We've got a good query
**      from Jonathan to do it, so that'll make some things easier to manage. Then we'll
**      get a bit closer to some consistent treatment of stuff...
** 18/ Needs better sectioning around the BARB minute stuff. BARB NYIP at all thus far.
**      Update: This is also going to involve changing the lower bound treatment, since
**      it's done at the moment by excluding these things as they come out of the daily
**      table. See the note at ##18##.
** 19/ Still don't have the scaling segments on it. Are we adding the scaling segments?
**      Maybe in a future release, or at least, not in the thing we're urgently pushing
**      out for the BARB v Vespa for Chris. Scaling segments also NYIP.
** 20/ Get the timeshifting treatment right, currently it doesn't wory at all. Might be
**      as easy as making sure that programme air date is included in the initial pull
**      though. Update: Got a patch, have yet to check that it works entirely.
**
** Things done:
** 1/ Define all the major tables being used
** 2/ Introduce some normalisation for efficiency
** 3/ Pull back to 1 day processing at once
** 4/ Tidy up the redundancy and terrible IO wastage
** 13/ Might think about getting some other grouping flag for the buckets within which
**      caps get built, so that we only have to join on the big combination of stuff
**      once (to get the bucket IDs back) rather than having to join on 6 fields all
**      the time... going to have to do something major if it's taking hours and hours
**      to build a single day of caps.
** 15/ Going to have to fully rebuild the bit where capped events get their new end
**      times: flatted the population out into a distributon with a fixed number of
**      entries and the cumulative-intervals trick for the random thing selection.
** 5/ Put results into a cache for each day
** 16/ Figure out if we're going to include the BARB minute and timeshift split stuff
**      into this build too, because that'd allow us to build the minute by minute
**      graphs really easily from the stored procedures again, and that'd e brilliant,
**      as it would include scaling and capping too and give us BARB MBM over the full
**      Sky base in one little procedure that takes maybe a minute to run.
** 11/ Convert the BARB minute allocation back to a lookup on cb_row_id. Though: How
**      do we allign the BARB minute definitions to shows that don't line up on exact
**      minute ends in the EPG? Are there any? Let's check... Update: that BARB minute
**      issue around the programme endpoints is automatically resolved, as we're not
**      grouping by the programe key or cb_row_id at all, we're just extending the
**      first viewing item contributing to the dominant component in the BARB minute.
**      Doing the BARB minute by minute for the later show which has minutes in the
**      earlier programme tag could be annoying though. We'll just flag that known
**      issue and point out that it doesn't happen with programmes that start and end
**      exactly on minute bounds.
** 6/ Logger calls, ongoing QA totals...
** 8/ Form as a stored procedure
** 10/ Historic rebuild, of course. Will be huge. Going to have to find out how much we
**      need. Update: we've set it up so that it automatically rebuilds periods of high
**      demand and then chuggs away with everything else when it runs out of high priority
**      items.
** 9/ Scheduler integration
** 14/ Need a procedue which resets all the capping stuff from the vespa_analysts schema
**      because there's a lot of junk that ends up in there that should be reset once
**      we're happy with the QA. Which is kind of odd because we're only ever going to
**      have the last day's worth of caps in it when the build finishes. That said, we
**      will be able to isolate one day to build if we need to check one particular QA
**      issue or something like.
**
** How far back are we refreshng the thing? Scaling goes back what, three weeks, do
** we intent to build three weeks worth of capps each week? could take a while to
** compute, good thing we're doing it at night...
**
** Sybase 15 client note: Sybase has some annoying behavioural changes from the
** client for Sybase 12, and if you have the wrong client settings you might get
** syntax errors (really? WTF?). The setting you need are hidden under:
**  Tools->Options->SybaseIQ->Commands
** There are two check boxes, "Commit after every statement" and "Commit on exit
** or disconnect" and you want to make sure both are ticked.

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    -- So we've given this section a pretty thorough overhaul and now it actually runs on a
    -- full day of data. Main points introduced:
    --  a. We're now batching by start hour, initial genre, and live/playback
    --  b. We've got a single numerical key which defines all combinations of the above in 1 integer
    --  c. Columns that never get used are no longer included on the capped and uncapped tables
    --  d. Indices are now directly tuned to support the joins in play
    --  e. We've bounded the uncapped population to a fixed number of items per bucket
    -- That said, this action is still the bottleneck for this entire capping build; it's taking
    -- hours to process even a single day's worth of caps, and this is pre-ramp up. Past ramp up
    -- with 3x as much data returned? We might end up capping one day of data in each overnight
    -- build. Good thing we have a scheduler that's able to check if the build has gone too far
    -- into the morning, leave things for the next day, and just pick up where it left off. And
    -- depending on how we made the prioritisation work... it can still build the regular reports
    -- before continuing with the capping tasks outstanding from the previous builds. Nice that
    -- we built a scheduler as solidly as we did then, eh?

    -- The buckets are simultaneously more agressive batching (smaller batches) and a lot cleaner
