        Purpose
        -------
In Jan / Feb an ATL campaign will be aired with the aim to reduce platform churn. 
The unproven hypothesis is that by improving the perceived value of Sky with the 
existing customer base, we will increase retention.  Specifically by raising awareness of new content, SkyGo and Sky+ 

        SECTIONS
        --------

        PART A   - Generate Segments around Likely/Unlikely to churn and Sky Go Usage and Sky+ Usage
             A01 - Likely/Unlikely to Churn - Using Value Segment status as at 15th october 2012
            Part 7 - Changed from Standard Value segmenat to add in splits where value segment allocation due to Syscan type activity
            (e.g., Syscan/Active Block)
             A02 - Sky Go Usage - Total Sky Go Usage in 3 month period - Also includes a split looking at Non-Sports Sky Go Activity
             A03 - Sky+ Usage - Does account have any playback activity

        Part B - Generate Overall HH base from which Segment Sizes are determined e.g., Midpoint population and weights

        Part C - Run Figures for 3+ minutes Live continuous viewing of any programme

        Part D - Aggregate HD/SD/+1 channel figures together to avoid duplication e.g., where someone watches Coronation Street on ITV1
                 and 3+ minutes of same programme an hour later on ITV1+1
