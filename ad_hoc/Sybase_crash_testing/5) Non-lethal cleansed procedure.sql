/*
        Purpose
        -------
        Replicate a server-destroying query. This is the non-lethal version.

        Sybase 15.2 apparently has problems cancelling a certain type of query.
        This will allegedly be fixed in 15.4, though we want to build some test
        situations with the query that gave us so much trouble the first time
        around.
        
        This script isolates the query that forced so many server restarts the
        first time around. Well, this query has all the stable stuff up to the
        big query that causes all the problems.
        
        This is the version for data cleansed of all identifying details, and
        we've also clipped out the comments so it's no longer quite so obvious
        how any of it fits into the business logic, but sure, it'll be a test.
