** Project Vespa: Panel Management Report
**                  - Weekly Refresh Script
**
** The Panel Management report looks at who stable the Vespa panel is with
** to scaling. Coverage of segments, over / under indexing of stuff, most
** needed boxes for upcoming activation, also one big metric that summarises
** the whole panel into a single performance percentage. This guy takes into
** account box reporting as well as  segmentation spread of the 
**
** See also:
**
**      http://rtci/vespa1/Panel%20Management%20Report.aspx
**
** OK So: we're building the main panel metrics over just the scaling variables,
** but a lot of the profiling and balance work we want to maintan vs these other
** variables as well.
**
** Still to do:
**
** 11. Build the rest of the box selection code, to mess around with segment indexes and box
**      reporting quality metrics to figure out how to fill the rest of panel after the 
**      stratified sampling has done the obvious candidates. Heh, givn the number of variables
**      we're trying to balance against, we're going to need to consider 1 box segments fairly
**      often... sadface. Refer to tags like ##11## and maybe also consider brief V068 for
**      basic things about how the post-ramp-up balance work was implemented.
** 13. Remaining item for implementation is the redundancy measure thing. Not that either of
**      the other panels is live yet, but hey.
** 26. Ensure the build is stable, check that the templating, VBA, everything like that lines up
** 28. Adjust (again) for the operational build of Scaling 2. Some table names have changed, the
**      output structure has changed, and we also now get to perhaps loop over that other table
**      of variables rather than have a huge section of hard-coding. Also might even abstract it
**      completely from the scaling build if we've got the variables in a lookup.
** 31. All the debug and suchlike. Can we actually run a build now, if we've got some scaling 2
**      structures in place?
** 32. Maybe recast the reset procedure so that it detects the schema and drops appropriately.
** 34. Ensure alignment of unit tests with Scaling 2 build - tables, new structures, etc
** 35. Add a parameter option to let us run panel management for any day, and default to the
**      standard profiling thursday if it's null. The mis-alignment with SBV won't matter so
**      much, we just want to be able to use it for test builds prior to us having the current
**      week of scaling build in play.
**
** Tables that are apparently in play in Vespa_Analysts:
** 
** Recently completed: (in order of completion)
** 10. Realign the box selection tricks to use the upgraded reporting quality metric now on SBV.
** 12. Look at archiving off the SHA1 keys so we don't have to rebuild them each week (because
**      Sybase seems pretty slow at it).
** 15. Turn the pair or bad reporting guys into a single good base coverage metric
** 16. Fill out the rest of the high level overview; as in, the traffic light things.
**  9. Still the automation stuff, including the transposing of the summary stuff and sorting
**      out all the title bits. And more termplating for changing requirements, heh.
** 18. We'll also need another household clasification for households that are new to Vespa
**      and haven't been around for long enough to have their reliability judged.
** 19. Need to change the SHA1 calculations into batching of 4k items per time, trying to do all
**      the hashes at once is prohibitively slow.
** 14. OnNet vs Offnet as an additional non-scaling variable
** 24. Fix the thing with the hash calculation omission
** 21. "Reliable" and "somewhat reliable" want to be combined into a single "acceptable" mark.
** 25. Add Sky Go users to the non-scaling variables breakdown
** 22. Add to unit tests checks on fixed length outputs
** 23. Add a thiung to the front page about reporting quality breakdown over the universes.
** 17. Maybe the data completeness metric only act over the scaling variables? Update: Yes
** 20. Upgrade for scaling 2!
**      i/ Check table & column names - DONE!
**      ii/ New single variable summaries - DONE
**      iii/ Recast sections using dialback intervals - DONE
**      iv/ Treatment for different universes? Update - DONE
**      v/ Templating - get the columns right, copy the formulas down, change OnNet traffic ligh to OnNet-OffNet - DONE
**      vi/ Demo & debug (will need to grant permissions lol)
**      vii/ Rebuild non-scaling variables so as to profile at same point as scaling... 10 days before or something? - DONE
**      viii/ Something to check that the manual section is completed, and re-queue the job in the scheduler if t's not - DONE
**      ix/ What else?
** 28. Break out non-scaling variables into sub-sections
** 29. Add the new fixed OnNet build detailed on the customer group wiki.
** 30. More QA control totals and suchlike, for internal consistency and suchlike.
** 27. Need a thing which checks that the dependent Scaling 2 build is complete [Update: No, it's autoamted now]
** 33. Table renamings for Operational build of Scaling 2
**
** Code sections:
**      Part A: A01 -  Initialise Logger
**              A02 -  Table Resets
**              A03 -  Temporal Bounds

**              D01 -  High level overviews for each panel
**              D02 -  Vespa reporting quality breakdown by scaling universe
**
**      Part M:        Panel modification work          - NYIP - this whole part isn't in play yet ##11##
**              M01 -  First round of box selection: up to stratification limit
**   ^          M02 -  Filling in selection gaps with Utility measure
**  [^]         M03 -  Final box selection round based on as-yet undecided magic
**              M04 -  Assembling lists of accounts to be moved about the place
**
**      Part Q:        Automated QA on stuff
**              Q01 -  Tests on Dashboard section
**              Q02 -  End-to-end control totals
**              Q04 -  Tests on panel migration lists   - NYIP - ##11##
**
**      Part R:        Are we having a report builds section?
**
**      Part T: T01 -  Permissions!
**
** ^ - still requires attention. Not many now.
**
** Definitions: We're considering a household to be "Acceptable" at reporting
** when every box returns data for at least 25 days, or 90% of days since
** enablement if the enablement happened more than 15 but less that 30 days
** ago (it's the reporting quality metric from SBV.) No data return on any
** box for the last 30 days is a "Zero reporting" rating, households with
** boxes enabled within the last 15 days are "Recently enabled", and anything
** else gets labeled "Unreliable".
**
** Underpinning this is a bit of an assumption that the Alternate Day panels
** will still return data for the whole period, and that we'll see them in every
** daily table. We might end up introducing a bias *away* from heavy TV watchers
** if a heavy TV watcher in the alternate day panels ends up without items in
** a daily table because it was a non-reporting day and the buffers got re-filled
** up with more recent stuff before the reporting happened. But hey, no idea how
** Alt6 and Alt7 will work until they actually turn up.

     /* The whole box selection thing isn't in play any more; we're doing kind of ad-hoc builds
     ** of migrations when we get around to it, but there's currently nothing about regularly
     ** tuning the panel or weekly balance tweaks or anything. ##11##

     -- So we need to create the three tables:
     --  * vespa_PanMan_11_panel_4_discontinuations
     --  * vespa_PanMan_12_panel_6_imports
     --  * vespa_PanMan_13_panel_7_imports
     -- These guys should end up with subscriber_id as primary keys.

     -- So this is our target panel sample size:

     commit

     -- So the only thing in there we don't have yet is... the rank of reporting quality
     -- withing each segment. (Over different segments, we want reporting quality, no rank,
     -- because we want to compare how much data we'd get back for each option.)
