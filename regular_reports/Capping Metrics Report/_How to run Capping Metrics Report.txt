1) Install procedures in your own schema from all scripts ("Capping Metrics Report - 01 Metadata.sql" through to "Capping Metrics Report - 20 Clean up.sql")
2) Run two queries at the top from "Capping Metrics Report - RUN.sql"
3) Set values for @varStartDate and @varEndDate:
    - typically, value from the first query (+1 day) is assigned to @varStartDate
    - value from the second query is assigned to @varEndDate
   Note 1: although nothing will break, to maximise efficiency report should not be run for more that one full week worth of data
4) Once the report has been run, open the report (Excel spreadsheet) and refresh all data tables (Data -> Refresh All)
   Note: if ODBC connection to Sybase is called differently than "DCSLOPSKPRD5", a pop up will be shown where a relevant connection must be selected
