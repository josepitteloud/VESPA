1) Install procedures in your own schema from all scripts ("Scaling Metrics Report - 01 Metadata.sql" through to "Scaling Metrics Report - 20 Clean up.sql")
2) Run two queries at the top from "Scaling Metrics Report - RUN.sql"
3) Set values for @varStartDate and @varEndDate:
    - typically, value from the first query (+1 day) is assigned to @varStartDate
    - value from the second query is assigned to @varEndDate
   Note 1: although nothing will break, to maximise efficiency report should not be run for more that one full week worth of data
   Note 2: some pages of the report are based on Sky weeks, so ideally the report should be run for full Sky weeks, i.e. calendar dates between Friday and Thursday
4) Once the report has been run, open the report (Excel spreadsheet) and refresh all data tables (Data -> Refresh All)
   Note: if ODBC connection to Sybase is called differently than "DCSLOPSKPRD5", a pop up will be shown where a relevant connection must be selected
