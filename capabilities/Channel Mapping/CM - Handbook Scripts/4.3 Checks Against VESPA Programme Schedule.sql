/* 4.3 Checks Against VESPA Programme Schedule
There is a migration process loading data into VPS. Check for the channels that have broadcast data but are not in Service_key_attributes or have broadcast data earlier than effective_from or later than effective_to dates.
Generally we are not interested in the data before 1/1/12.
