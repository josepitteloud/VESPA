/******************************************************************************
**
** Project Vespa: Single box view
**                  - Weekly refresh
**
** Got to figure out when this refresh will happen, and put it in the scheduler.
** Probably at the beginning of every week, using the previous SAV refresh etc?
**
** Unfortunately the table population is messy. It's cleaned up a bit with the
** CCN coming into play, and we're now just using whatever is in the subscriber
** status table as our definitive listing of what's on Vespa.
**
** See also:
**      http://rtci/vespa1/Single%20box%20view.aspx
**
** Code sections:
**      Part A: A01 -  Initialise Logger
**              A02 -  Reset working & holding table
**
**      Part B:        Assembling box listing
**              B01 -  Confirmations from Midas campaign cells
**              B02 -  Forming the population
**              B03 -  Panel 4 marks by campaign cells
**              B04 -  Vespa flags fom Vespa DB
**              B05 -  Sky View Panel flags
**              B06 -  What is (probably) be Panel 4 based on enablement date
**              B07 -  Active DTV flag, standard UK account
**              B08 -  ACTIVE BOX FLAGS ON PANEL 12
**              B09 -  Flags for alternate panels 6 & 7
**              B10 -  Reducing population to active boxes (try to avoid temp space errors) - DISCONTINUED
**              B11 -  Definitive single flag for which panel each box is on
**
**      Part C:        Primary / Secondary flags
**              C01 -  From Olive
**              C02 -  From Vespa STB Log Lookup
**              C03 -  Attempting to infer the P/S flag in non-explicit cases...
**              C04 -  Combined decided flag (the one to use)
**
**      Part D:        Enablement dates
**              D01 -  Historical enablement dates from subscriber history
**              D02 -  Combined enablement date decision
**
**      Part E:        Other Vespa profiling / derived variables
**              E01 -  Viewing data present for each one of last 30 days
**              E02 -  Box reporting reliability metric
**
**      Part G:        Profiling variables from Customer Database
**              G01 -  Box type
**              G02 -  Anytime + flags
**              G03 -  PvR
**              G04 -  HD flags
**              G05 -  Premiums (they're an account thing, yes, but they get used all the time)
**              G06 -  3D TV flags
**              G07 -  cb_individual_key for linking to 3rd party data
**    G08 -  Archiving Quality metrics
**
** ^: these are bottleneck sections. They go to the Olive DB, not much can be
** done about it, they just slow. Sometimes a join will speed them up, sometimes
** not so much.
**
** Downside: we have three tables for which account_number should be a primary
** key; the subscriber status, the STB log snapshot, and now our single box
** view. Oh well.
**
** To do:
**  12. Realign the physical and subscription box types (might break OpDash)
**  13. Improve duplication checking when bringing items in from customer DB
**  14. Alternate panels 6 and 7 will turn up sometime soon and we'll need to
**          identify and flag those appropriately - see ##14## for line refs
**  18. We've got Service Instance ID on the daily tables. Are we going to use
**          that to fill in some of the gaps where we didn't get service instance
**          ID fro mthe customer database?
**  22. Remove the 'EnablePending' check once the 4->12 migration is complete
**          - see ##22## - Update: 'Trumped' is also on the list of things which
**          - now really mean Enabled too, awesome, messy.
**  23. Now there's treatment on the customer group wiki on how to link to
**          ConsumerView; see http://mktskyportal/Campaign%20Handbook/ConsumerView.aspx
**          and also look for the ##23## dev note.
**
** Done:
**  17. Additional reporting quality metric that also considers enablement date
**  19. Revoke team SELECT permissions at the beginning of the build and grant
**          them back again after the build is complete. (Could do that for the
**          scaling build too?)
**  20. Stability vs unexpected restarts: check who has permissions on SBV and
**          also make the index drop at the start of the daily pulls conditional,
**          because Sybase will stop and error if it tries to remove something
**          that isn't there.
**  21. Improved proc logging visibility, so that the logging name is determined
**          by the namespace the table is in, and not the name of the user running
**          the build proc. That's a bit better (though slightly messier to code).
