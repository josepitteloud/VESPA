--- Skyview scaling uses 2 of the Scaling 3.0 procedures. See the repository for more details
-- \Git_repository\Vespa\ad_hoc\V154 - Scaling 3.0\Vespa Analysts - SC3\SC3 - 3 - refresh procedures [v1.1].sql

-- These procs prepare the Skybase accounts (to be done once a week for a Thursday) and valid Vespa accounts (to be run each day)
--        SC3_v1_1__do_weekly_segmentation  SKYVIEW VERSION: V289_M11_01_SC3_v1_1__do_weekly_segmentation
--        SC3_v1_1__prepare_panel_members   SKYVIEW VERSION: V289_M11_02_SC3_v1_1__prepare_panel_members


--- A new procedure has been written to add individual level data to the scaling tables
--     V289_M11_03_SC3I_v1_1__add_individual_data

--- An existing Scaling 3.0 proc has been ammended to work for SkyView
-- This proc calculates the weights using a RIM Weighting process
