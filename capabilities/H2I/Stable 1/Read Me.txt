* Major updates to include non-viewer assignment
	
* Execution steps:

	1.	(Re)Build procedures using code from
			\Vespa\capabilities\H2I\stable_1\
		using concat_H2I_modules.bat script and execute

	2.	Execution
		/*	-- If required, clean up all H2I objects from local schema (NOTE - this will also drop the procedures, in which case simply repeat step 1 before proceeding)
		EXECUTE V289_M000c_drop_H2I_objects;
		*/

		-- Run H2I (change target date and sample size as appropriate)
		execute v289_m00_initialisation '2013-09-20';
		execute v289_m000_Prevalidation '2013-09-20';
		execute v289_m01_process_manager 1, '2013-09-20', 100;

* Bug fixes:
	- local schema references removed
	- M000b included in build script
	- Crash bug fixed in M01 when called with (@fresh_start = 1) argument *FROM A FRESH SCHEMA*
	- dynamic SQL bugs fixed that caused build-crash when all query-terminators (;) are interpreted
	
* Execution steps:
	1.	(Re)Build procedures using code from:
	\Vespa\capabilities\H2I\stable_1\
	2.	Execution
		a.	Run M00 procedure to create tables (if running for the first time)
				execute v289_m00_initialisation;
		b.	Run M000 prevalidation to create necessary views and copy of PI_BARB_import from the vespa_shared schema (needed since this has been updated today)
				execute v289_m000_Prevalidation [TARGET DATE];
		c.	Run M03 to perform import from PI_BARB_import table (needed just once due to the above)
				execute v289_m03_barb_data_extraction;
		d.	Run the rest of the procedure
				execute v289_m01_process_manager [@fresh_start], [TARGET DATE], 100;

* BARB data referenced from static data import @ vespa_shared.PI_BARB_import (see module M03)
* Execution steps:
	1.	(Re)Build procedures using code from:
	\Vespa\capabilities\H2I\stable_1\
	2.	Execution
		a.	Run M00 procedure to create tables (if running for the first time)
		execute v289_m00_initialisation today();
		b.	Run M000 prevalidation to create necessary views and copy of PI_BARB_import from the vespa_shared schema (needed since this has been updated today)
		execute v289_m000_Prevalidation [TARGET DATE];
		c.	Run M03 to perform import from PI_BARB_import table (needed just once due to the above)
		execute v289_m03_barb_data_extraction;
		d.	Run the rest of the procedure
		execute v289_m01_process_manager 1, [TARGET DATE], 100;
