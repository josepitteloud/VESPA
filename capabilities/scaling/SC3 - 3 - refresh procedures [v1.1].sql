/******************************************************************************
**
** Project Vespa: Scaling - Refresh procedures
**
** These procedures update the core scaling tables with new reporting data.
** There are a couple of fundamental changes to support scaling 2. Profiling
** gets done on a different loop (analytics 9PM once a week), everythign else
** gets done once a day in a separate loop. Next, panel membership decisions
** are isolated in their own stored procedure, because that might change too.
** Finally, all the calculations go one day at a time from the lists already
** built.
**
** Refer to:
**
**      http://rtci/Vespa1/Scaling.aspx
**      http://rtci/Vespa1/VIQ%20interim%20scaling.aspx
**
**
** Code sections: now adjusted to support VIQ internal interim! Or, VIQII.
** Might appear out of order, but the order will change around when the
** processes actually get run anyway, so it's not a big deal.
**
**      Part L:       Weekly profiling (run weekly in 9PM analytics queue)
**              L01 - Get account population
**              L02 - Pull together all the flags & variables
**              L03 - Assign scaling segment ID
**              L04 - Publishing segmentation to interface tables
**
**      Part A:       Virtual panel balance (or placeholder thereof)
**
**              A00 - Clean transient tables
**              A01 - Accounts reporting last week
**
**      Part B:       Building actual scaling weights!
**
**              B01 - Totals of base and panel by segment
**              B02 - Calculate segment weights
**              B03 - Publishing weights to interface tables
**
**      Part E:       Consistency tests on scaling numbers built by date
**
**              E01 - Total of base segments should match count of base
**              E02 - Weighting total matches Sky base
**
**      Part F:       Consistency tests over weekly builds
**
**              F01 - Intervals shouldn't overlap
**              F02 - Vespa panel should be contained within Sky base
**              F03 - Should not have any NULL segmentation IDs
**              F04 - ROI and non-standard accounts in Vespa Panel
**              F05 - Interval vs weighting consistency check
**              F06 - Convergence of Rim weighting method
**
**      Part I:
**              I01 - The central refresh procedure (defaults to one day)
**
**      Part P:
**              P01 - Permisisons!
**
** To do:
** 19. Update documentation (in all the places) for the Scaling 2 dev (who is
**      responsible for doing this?)
** 21. Update for Phase 2 data structure. Should only affect Fuzzy A on the
**      scaling data flow picture?
**
** Completed items:
** 16. New segmentation definitions from Sarah's work. Fuzzy Area B.
** 18. Implement new rim weighting mechanic. Fuzzy Area C.
** 15. Viewing definition updates - modularise so that it's easily modified
**      during virtual panel balance work. Fuzzy Area A.
** 24. Clean up sectioning in transposed code blocks
** 25. Drop temporary tables after final use in transposed code blocks
** 26. Newly transposed code blocks need the logger too eh?
** 27. Migrate in those QA queries too. Though, they just record basic stats,
**      we'll still need some tests indicating when to raise flag sthat they
**      didn't work out.
** 17. Update segmentations to use Experian instead of ILU & new BARB regions
** 23. Make sure to clear out any existing values already in any of the tables
**      of the same build dates. Except maybe the final delivery interface.
** 20. Sophisticated historic rebuild management including auditing, leading
**      into Plan AB+ because that's probably going to be how VIQ gets done.
**      [Update: no, we're just going to handle this manually, *maybe*]
**
** Remember also to search for ## and address all the dev points flagged there.
**
** Generally these guys are not mentioning vespa_analysts specifically so that
** we can throw together separate testing instances in our different schemas.
