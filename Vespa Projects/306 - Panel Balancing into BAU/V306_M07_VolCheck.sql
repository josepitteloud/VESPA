**Business Brief:

Panel Balancing is a regular exercise to ensure that the viewing panel is as
representative of the wider Sky customer base as possible as the latter evolves over
time. Balancing is also crucial in ensuring that key KPI and contractual obligations
of account coverage are maintained.




**Module:                              M07_VolCheck

This module adds additional accounts to the panels if any are required to meet the requirements for TA propensity coverage, virtual panel coverage, or business requirements for the primary or combined panels.
If the maximum size of the primary or combined panels has been exceeded, then the required number of accounts rae removed from the panels.
