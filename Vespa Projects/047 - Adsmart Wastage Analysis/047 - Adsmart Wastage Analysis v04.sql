--http://rtci/Lists/RTCI%20IC%20dev/DispForm.aspx?ID=47&Source=http%3A%2F%2Frtci%2FLists%2FRTCI%2520IC%2520dev%2FProjectInceptionView%2Easpx

/*  From Sharepoint
To understand the viability of various AdSmart and linear trading approaches, we wish understand how much inventory could be created 
through just trading linear ‘wastage’.  In order to identify the reachable wastage from the BARB traded audience we have had to define a set of
 ‘Mirror Segments’, which define the reachable audiences for each BARB traded audience. 
The reason we cannot reach all of the wastage is that AdSmart cannot identify which householder is watching at any one point in time, 
therefore whilst there might be wastage in an advert bought against housewives with children if someone other than the housewife is 
viewing the television there is no way for us to identify and then serve a different advert to this person. However we could in this 
situation still deliver alternative advertising to any household with no children as nobody in that household (with the exception of visitors) 
would fall into the BARB traded demographic. The brief is still being refined by Rory Skrebowski.

/*
Analysis looks to build a universe of a Households in UK with detailes of whether the households has 1 or more people in 
each of the tradeable demographics e.g., Male 16-54

This is then matched to the spot traded data to calculate what proportion of households that viewed the advert are not on the traded demographic

As data on sk_prod.ilu does not exactly match the traded demographics the following work arounds have been created
ILU Has Adults as 18+ BARB Traded Demographics are 16+
ILU_HHSocioEcon groups together C1 and C2 And has retired seperately where on BARB C1 and C2 are seperated and retired HH 
are grouped within the A/B/C1/C2/D/E classes
