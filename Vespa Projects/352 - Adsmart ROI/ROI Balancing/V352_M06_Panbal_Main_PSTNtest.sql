**Business Brief:

Panel Balancing is a regular exercise to ensure that the viewing panel is as
representative of the wider Sky customer base as possible as the latter evolves over
time. Balancing is also crucial in ensuring that key KPI and contractual obligations
of account coverage are maintained.




**Module:                              M06_Main

This module is the central loop of the balancing process. After initialising all of the tables which are used within this module, it calculates the imbalance for each variable in the traffic_lights table.
If any of the variables has an imbalance higher than the lmit then another loop of the process is induced.
A loop of the code adds a number of accounts to the panel (set by @precision) to minimise the maximum imbalance.
