**Business Brief:

Capping Calibration Automation ultimately aims to deliver improved Vespa viewing consumption through monthly alignment to BARB reference data. 
The Capping algorithm was developed in order to truncate the length of viewing events where there is no actual audience present (e.g. TV set off, but STB on and registering viewing).

Up to this point, the parameters and thresholds that feed into the Capping algorithm have been largely static since the time of the original algorithm development by IQ and ultimate implementation within EDM. 
Although a recent capping calibration exercise addressed exactly the issue realigning Vespa viewing to BARB, this was a highly manual process that required much resource to construct and perform the analyses and assessment. 
Capping Calibration Automation will adopt those calculations and fundamental approach, but delivered as a self-contained and automated process that calculates the best set of capping thresholds and parameters in IQ/Olive 
for ingest within into the EDM production environment

This project will also aim to increase the precision over which the Capping thresholds and parameters operate. For example, the current parameters are defined at the day-part level, 
each of which spans a number of hours in the day. The intention is to explore the possibility of redefining the parameters at the hourly level in order to give greater control over the alignment process against BARB. 
In theory, there should be little to no adjustment required to the actual flow of the Capping algorithm since the thresholds and parameters are contained in an external lookup table rather than being hard-coded in the SQL.




**Module:                               V306_CP2_M04_Profiling

-- We don't need to profile each box on each different day, we're just going to profile
-- once a week (or something like that) at the beginning of the build week and use that
-- for the whole week. This way isn't going to be super robust against race conditions,
-- but the scheduler is fairly robust against two things running the same proc at the
-- same time. Still, we can also throw the build date onto the metadata table to ensure
-- things don't get desynchronised.
